    "description": "Eye-tracking is essential in cognitive neuroscience research, yet preprocessing workflows remain fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to reproduce across labs. To address this, we've developed BIDS Extension Proposal 20 (BEP20) and conversion tools (https://github.com/bids-standard/eye2bids) to standardize eye-tracking data formats. We are now aiming at building eyetracking preprocessing tools that make this standard immediately practical and valuable.\nEyePrep is designed as an open-source preprocessing pipeline that serves dual purposes:\n  - Incentivize BIDS adoption by providing immediate value once data is formatted correctly\n  - Automated preprocessing and quality control of eyetracking data",
    "goals": "1: Core Infrastructure (Essential)\n\n*Quality Control System*\n- Implement automated QC metrics (data loss %, blink rate, drift magnitude, SNR)\n- Create before/after comparison visualizations for each preprocessing step\n- Deliverable: Every preprocessing run produces a detailed QC report\n\n*Extension of preprocessing steps*\n- Add to existing structure (blink removal methods, smoothing techniques etc)\n- Command-Line Interface \n- Design intuitive CLI with clear parameter names and helpful error messages\n- Implement parameter validation \n- Create configuration file system (YAML/JSON) for reproducible workflows\n- Add comprehensive logging for debugging and transparency\n- Deliverable: Single command preprocessing: eyeprep /data/bids /data/output --config standard\n\n*Documentation & Tutorials*\n- Write comprehensive \"Getting Started\" guide with real examples\n- Create step-by-step tutorial notebooks for common preprocessing workflows\n- Document all preprocessing parameters: what they do, when to use them, typical ranges\n- Deliverable: Users can go from BIDS data to preprocessed output in <30 minutes\n\n2: User Experience (Important)\n\n*Interactive Dashboard*\n- Build web-based parameter exploration tool (Streamlit)\n- Implement real-time preprocessing preview with parameter sliders\n- Create interactive visualizations (zoomable time series, animated scan paths)\n- Add export functionality for chosen configurations\n- Deliverable: Non-coders can explore preprocessing effects visually",
    "learning": "Participants will learn core signal-processing principles and how to turn a research idea into a usable, community-driven BIDS App for eye-tracking data, from initial concept and foundational code to a robust preprocessing tool.",
