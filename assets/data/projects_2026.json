    "description": "As members of the Institute of Developmental Biology of Marseille, we are interested in how a whole organism can emerge from a single cell. Although all cells contain the same genetic material, they differentiate during embryonic development into bone, skin, muscle, and many other cell types. This process is guided by a combination of factors, including gene regulation, interactions with neighboring cells, and chemical signals called morphogens, which form gradients that tell cells what they should become based on their position.\n\nInspired by a cellular automata video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJNeq-WABU\n) showing how complex structures such as a lizard can arise from simple local rules, we want to recreate and extend this idea into a more complex system. By adjusting and adding rules, such as multiple cell types and different signals, we aim to explore how simple interactions can generate organized patterns. \n\nUltimately, we would like to apply this framework to model aspects of early brain development, in particular to model neurulation. \n\nWe do not aim to replicate real biology in detail, but rather to explore how far simple, biologically inspired rules can go in producing lifelike structures. We therefore want to experiment with key developmental patterning mechanisms, such as morphogen gradients and HOX-gene–like positional identity, to guide how cells differentiate and organize in space. And, of course, most importantly, we want to have fun exploring what emerges.",

    "leaders": "Marieva Vlachou",
    "collaborators": "Jean Blouin",
    "description": "This project is part of my PhD research on the processing of tactile spatial information. In a behavioral experiment, blindfolded participants explored the contour of a textured two-dimensional (2D) shape by tracing it with their index finger. Following this tactile exploration, participants completed two tasks:\n\nShape reproduction: participants were asked to reproduce the perceived shape by drawing it once with their finger.\n\nShape identification: participants were asked to identify the explored shape from a set of fifteen candidate shapes printed on a sheet (see attached figure). These candidates varied systematically in their geometric configuration and curvature, spanning different levels of similarity to the explored “reference” shape.\n\nThe central objective of this project is to quantify the similarity between the reference shape and the shapes either reproduced or selected by participants, by identifying variables that best capture shape similarity. As an initial approach, we employed Procrustes analysis and related geometric alignment methods commonly used in shape analysis to quantify dissimilarity between the reference shape, the reproduced shapes, and the perceived alternatives. However, when applied to this predefined set of shapes, these standard metrics did not yield satisfactory results: in particular, they failed to reproduce the intended similarity ranking of the candidate shapes (from most similar:1 to least similar:14, as illustrated in attached figure).\n\nThe shape data were extracted from video recordings of the tracing and drawing tasks and are represented as two-dimensional coordinate sequences (x–y contours) stored in spreadsheet format. \n\nThe challenge addressed by this project is to demonstrate the limitations of widely used shape similarity metrics when applied in isolation and to explore alternative, more integrative methods capable of capturing global shape similarity in complex or abstract 2D forms.\n\n<img width=\"510\" height=\"721\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ece6808-1b5a-4114-a63b-831d5fac97bc\" />",
    "goals": "The goal of this project is to identify a metric, or a combination of complementary metrics, that can reliably capture and rank the similarity of the predefined set of 2-D shapes (see attached figure), and subsequently apply this similarity measure to the unknown shapes drawn by participants after the tactile exploration task.\n\n- Review and reproduce baseline shape similarity methods (e.g., Procrustes analysis, Chamfer distance, contour-based metrics) on the predefined shape set.\n- Quantitatively evaluate the limitations of these single-metric approaches by testing whether they recover the known similarity ranking of the predefined shapes.\n- Establish a shared data pipeline for loading, resampling, aligning, and visualizing 2D shape contours (MATLAB or Python).\n- Implement and compare multiple complementary shape descriptors (e.g., geometric ratios, curvature-based measures, frequency-domain descriptors, matching costs).\n- Explore CNN-inspired early-layer feature extraction (e.g., edge and orientation filters applied to rasterized shapes) as an alternative shape representation.\n\n**Expected deliverables**\nA benchmark comparison of single-metric versus multivariate shape similarity approaches.",
